# Notes, Features, Bugs & Improvements #

Can I use Recoil to store recommended playlists? 
- i.e. an atom for an array of playlist id returned by the recommender

Add postgresql to collect user data and playlist data when user logs in

Include BPM for songs because we want this app to be helpful to DJs as well

How are we going to deploy the recommender model so that...
- we can send requests from the app through an API
- we can share access tokens with the recommender
- when user x logs in, the recommender suggests playlists for user x

Fix screen breakpoints for the application

Can I cache the playlists that have been rendered in the app?
- So that we don't have to render them again whenever the page is refreshed.

Set standard screen width for the application:
- So that the width doesn't change when objects are clicked/rendered
- This will also mean resizing some text elements

Add external playlist link to each playlist

Add user name and playlist title to each playlist tile on the recommendations page

Our current recommendation model uses content-based filtering:
- Content-based filtering is a technique for finding similar items in a dataset
- Thaker's model uses a playlist vector to summarize the songs in a playlist
- We should update the model to create a playlist vector for each playlist and use this to find similar playlists
- How can we connect our model to a postgresql database?
